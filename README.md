# PyInstaller
A customizable installer for programs or packages, written in Python.

(//): [ (There is a bash version avalible, as well.) ]

## Note:
I reccomend using this as a curl installer. To do it, just use the command
`curl -s https://path/to/your/installer | python3`
[ or if you're using the bash/sh version:
`curl -s https://path/to/your/installer | bash` ]

You can, of course, use it in another way though! :3
